# Requirements #
Raven has been tested on both Windows XP SP2 and Linux Mint Cassandra (Ubuntu 6.10).

Raven was written with Python 2.6 (the current version in the repository uses 2.7), and it uses the new multiprocessing library for background processing. Raven also depends upon the Tkinter library for its GUI.

# Starting the Game #
There is a Windows (.zip) version of Raven under the Downloads tab. Once you unzip the files to a folder on your system, you can double-click the raven.exe file to start the game.

Alternatively, you can pull the source files out of the Mercurial repository. Once you've downloaded all the Raven files to a directory on your system, open a console window, 'cd' to that directory and type "python mainframe.py" to start the game. (Of course, this assumes you have the Python 2.6/2.7 directory in your PATH variable.)

If something goes wrong and you can't start the game, please file a bug report under the [Issues page](http://code.google.com/p/raven-checkers/issues/list). Thanks.
